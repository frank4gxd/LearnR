## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
#Create data
set.seed(1)
Ixos=rnorm(4000 , 120 , 30)     
Primadur=rnorm(4000 , 200 , 30) 
 
# First distribution
hist(Ixos, breaks=30, xlim=c(0,300), col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5), xlab="height", 
     ylab="nbr of plants", main="distribution of height of 2 durum wheat varieties" )

# Second with add=T to plot on top
hist(Primadur, breaks=30, xlim=c(0,300), col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5), add=T)

# Add legend
legend("topright", legend=c("Ixos","Primadur"), col=c(rgb(1,0,0,0.5), 
     rgb(0,0,1,0.5)), pt.cex=2, pch=15 )

```


```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

c <- rnorm(100,mean=50,sd=10)

ggplot(mapping=aes(x=c-mean(c),y=dnorm(c,mean(c),sd(c))))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "loess")



source("subfunc/my_func.R")

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
